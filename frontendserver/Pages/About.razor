<h1>About the project</h1>
<p>
    A project created using serverside rendering Blazor for the Visual
    Programming Language course in Ventspils University of Apllied Sciences
    in December of 2020.
</p>

<p>
    Basic simulation of some kind of entities transmiting a disiease from
    one to another.
</p>

<p>
    This project is not suitable to be placed on a server! It uses
    multithreaded computing for managing the entities within the canvas - all
    done serverside! The project was built like this because I wanted to try
    out Blazor and I wanted to learn more about mutlithreaded programming.
